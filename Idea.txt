App - Habbits replacer
User signup
Detailed q and a to analyse behaviour 
Time limit to stop apps selected - social media apps, ask user about apps
break time slots - for using apps 
once time slot is over redirect user to -> where he wants to build good habbits
then if he switches back to youtube then assign another task -> hence modle will learn dynamically 
activities that consume more will power that will be suggested at evening or morning but activies that consume less will power will
be suggested at afternoon 

app will lock other selected apps once the time limit is over 

redirect user to productive tasks such as podcasts on spotify etc
